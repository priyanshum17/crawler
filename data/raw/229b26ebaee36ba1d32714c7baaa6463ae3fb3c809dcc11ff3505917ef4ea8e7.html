He was awarded a lifetime achievement award from ACM SIGCHI, and in 1997 was recognized by ACM SIGGRAPH with the prestigious Steven A. Coons Award. The Foley Scholars Endowment was established upon the 15th&nbsp;anniversary of GVU, and supports two scholars each year who demonstrate “overall brilliance and potential impact.”</p><h5><strong>Alton P. “Pete” Jensen</strong>&nbsp;– computer science professor</h5><p>Professor, Computer Science: Jensen served as the Acting Director of the School of Information and Computer Sciences from 1987 to 1990. Jensen co-chaired the committee that first conceived of a broad-based College of Computing, and also helped to guide the subsequent creation of the college. Jensen started at Georgia Tech as a research engineer in 1954 and in addition to his administrative duties taught computing for the next 37 years. He advised dozens of local entrepreneurs and politicians, including former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Jensen also served on Jimmy Carter’s Presidential Transition Team.</p><h5><strong>Janet L. Kolodner</strong>&nbsp;– Interactive Computing Regents’ Professor Emeritus, cognitive&nbsp;learning&nbsp;</h5><p>Regents’ Professor Emerita Janet L. Kolodner joined GA Tech’s School of Information and Computer Science (ICS) in December 1980, and retired from the School of Interactive Computing in August 2014, with almost 34 years of service. She is a Fellow of the Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and an Inaugural Fellow of the International Society for the Learning Sciences. She was founding Director of Georgia Tech's EduTech Institute;&nbsp;founding Editor in Chief of&nbsp;<em>The Journal of the Learning Sciences</em>&nbsp;and Editor-in-Chief Emeritus;&nbsp;and a founder of the International Society for the Learning Sciences (ISLS) and its first Executive Officer. From 2010-2014, she was a program officer at the US National Science Foundation and led efforts to establish and sustain the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17520/nsf17520.htm">Cyberlearning Program</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Janet's research has addressed a wide variety of issues in learning, memory, and problem solving, both in computers and in people. During the 1980s, she and her students pioneered the computer method called case-based reasoning (CBR), which allows a computer to reason and learn from its experiences. The first case-based design aids (CBDA'S) came from her lab. Archie-2, for example, helped architecture students with conceptual design. During the early 1990s,&nbsp;she and her students used the cognitive model implied by case-based reasoning to address issues in creative design. &nbsp;JULIA planned meals, Creative JULIA figured out what to do with leftover rice, and ALEC simulated Alexander Graham Bell in his invention of the telephone. &nbsp;During the 1990s, she also became a designer of middle school science curriculum and learning technologies informed by CBR’s cognitive model. The approach, developed in collaboration with a wide variety of post-doctoral fellows and research scientists, called &nbsp;Learning by Design (LBD), is design-driven, inquiry-oriented, and project-based; children learn science in the context of design experiences. The sequencing of activities encourages students to reflect on their experiences in ways that CBR says are appropriate for productively integrating what they are learning into memory. LBD curriculum units and the sequencing structures from LBD are integrated into a published 3-year middle-school science curriculum called&nbsp;<a href="https://activatelearning.com/project-based-inquiry-science">Project-Based Inquiry Science (PBIS)</a>.</p><p>In later work, Janet and her students investigated how to help pre-teens and young teens consider who they are as thinkers and come to value informed decision making and informed production and consumption of evidence in the context of design-based learning activities. In&nbsp;<a href="http://home.cc.gatech.edu/ksi">Kitchen Science Investigators</a>, 5th and 6th graders came to think about themselves as scientific reasoners and kitchen scientists in the context of cooking and baking. In Hovering Around, they did so in the context of designing hovercraft. Those investigations and a recent investigation of the use of Harvard’s EcoMUVE in middle-school classrooms are leading to suggestions about how to design project challenges and virtual worlds that support their achievement so that they afford deep learning, motivate and sustain engagement over time, and foster student identities as accomplished and comfortable scientific thinkers and problem solvers.</p><p>Since September&nbsp;2017, Janet has been a half-time faculty member in the Lynch School of Education and Human Development at Boston College. She has been designing an MA Program in Learning Engineering, the design of effective and engaging learning experiences. It will educate the next generation of applied learning scientists who will, she hopes, help to make our formal and informal educational spaces places of joyful learning. The first cohort of students will join the program in Fall Semester, 2019.</p><h5><strong>Tom E. Noonan</strong>&nbsp;– Engineer, venture capitalist, and philanthropist</h5><p>M.E. 1983: Noonan is a member of the College of Computing Advisory Board. He is the General Manager of Energywise Solutions for Cisco Systems and an active venture capitalist through his venture firm, Techoperators LLC. Earlier in his career, he founded JouleX, an energy management company, and ISS, an internet security company that pioneered the industry’s first automated intrusion and vulnerability detection systems. He serves on the White House National Infrastructure Advisory Council, and on the board of directors for the Woodruff Arts Center, the Georgia Tech Foundation, the Georgia Tech Athletic Association, Georgia Research Alliance, and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. Noonan is an active philanthropist through the work of the Thomas E. Noonan Family foundation.</p><hr><h4>Class Zero</h4><h5><strong>Dorothy Murray Crosland&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Founder of Information Science at Georgia&nbsp;Tech</h5><p>Crosland was born on Sept. 13, 1903, in Stone Mountain, Georgia, the daughter of Robert and Lena Jones Murray. She graduated from Girls’ High School in Atlanta in 1920 and earned her library degree in&nbsp;1923 from the Library School of the Carnegie Library of Atlanta (later Emory University School of Library Science). After completing her education, she worked as an assistant cataloger and branch librarian at the Carnegie Library (now Atlanta- Fulton Public Library). In 1925, she became assistant librarian at the Georgia Institute of Technology, serving as acting librarian during Frances Newman’s leaves of absence. She was appointed librarian in 1927, a position she held until 1953 when her title was changed to director of libraries. She retired from Georgia Tech in 1971.</p><p>Crosland belonged to numerous professional organizations and received many honors. In 1945, she was named Atlanta’s Woman of the Year in Education, and in 1969, was named Woman of the Year in Professions. Georgia Tech made her an honorary alumna in 1961, and in 1962, the library staff association and friends presented an oil portrait of Crosland to the library. The governor proclaimed April 13, 1971, as Dorothy M. Crosland Day.</p><p>Crosland was instrumental in the founding of a graduate program in information science in 1963, which evolved into the College of Computing. She also played a key role in securing the admission of women to Georgia Tech.</p><p>At President Blake Van Leer’s request, she surveyed colleges and universities to determine which offered engineering and architecture degrees to women.</p><p>Discovering that Georgia was the only state that did not have a private or public engineering or architecture school for women, she wrote a persuasive letter to Rutherford Ellis, Education Committee chair for the Board of Regents, urging them to permit women to attend Tech. As a result, Georgia Tech admitted its first women students. Crosland also became responsible for furnishing and decorating the women’s dorm, then a house on Fifth Street.</p><h5><strong>Peter A. Freeman</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Founding Dean and Professor Emeritus&nbsp;</h5><p>Freeman was the Founding Dean of the College of Computing in 1990 and served as the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing until 2002.

He previously held positions at George Mason University, Johns Hopkins University, the University of California at Irvine, and Carnegie-Mellon.</p><p>At Georgia Tech, he began with a college of about 30 faculty, annual research of less than $2 million, and a few hundred students. Freeman transformed the college into a dynamic group of 65 faculty, annual research well in excess of $10 million, and almost 2,000&nbsp;students. During Freeman’s tenure, several of the research groups in the College became acknowledged national leaders in fields ranging from theory to Human- Computing Interaction.</p><p>As an assistant director of NSF, Freeman helped formulate national science policy., He was also responsible for a number of activities that continue to have major impacts on computing, including the Information Technology Research Program, cyberinfrastructure initiatives, the GENI Internet Research project, Broadening Participation in Computing, and the Computing Community Consortium.</p><p>Freeman is currently a co-principal investigator on an NSF grant to develop and analyze the history of CISE. He also engages in a variety of pro bono writing and speaking activities, serves on several advisory boards, and provides strategic and operational guidance for organizations involved in research, education, and development. He lives in Washington, DC.</p><p>Dr. Freeman is a Fellow of ACM, IEEE, and AAAS. He received his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University (1970), his M.A. in mathematics and psychology from University of Texas at Austin (1965), and his&nbsp;B.A. in physics and mathematics from Rice University (1963).</p><h5><strong>John P. Imlay, Jr. -</strong>&nbsp;Technology pioneer, entrepreneur, philanthropist, sports enthusiast, loving family man</h5><p>B.S.&nbsp;1959 – Industrial Management - Imlay&nbsp;had many talents and many passions.&nbsp;Born in Jacksonville, Florida, and raised in Savannah, Georgia, Imlay moved to Atlanta in 1954 to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology and never looked back. His love of Atlanta influenced his career in software, his angel investing, his philanthropy, his friends, and his family.</p><p>Following early years at Honeywell and Univac, in 1970 Imlay took a bankrupt company, Management Science America (MSA), and built it into one of the nation’s most successful software companies. MSA also became an incubator for technology executives whom Imlay mentored as they&nbsp;made their own way, spawning some 100 new companies.</p><p>MSA went into the public market in 1981 and in 1990, Imlay sold MSA to Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation. To further mentor the burgeoning technology community in Atlanta, Imlay established Imlay Investments, Inc. Over the next 20 years, he worked with more than 120 technology companies as an angel investor.</p><p>In 1990, he established The Imlay Foundation, Inc., which continues to be a mainstay of philanthropy in Atlanta and Scotland, with an added emphasis on fostering small, entrepreneurial nonprofits, reflecting his business career.</p><p>Imlay was an avid golfer and sports fan, purchasing an interest in the Atlanta Falcons in 1991. He also helped build the legacy of his hero, Bobby Jones, through the support of the Bobby Jones Scholars, the Bobby Jones Ethics Program at Emory University, founding Friends of Bobby Jones, sponsoring The Art of Golf exhibit at The High Museum, and countless speaking engagements on his favorite subject – Bobby Jones.</p><p>As a golfer, Imlay was a member of seven golf clubs in Atlanta and Scotland. his love of Scotland was anchored in Westerdunes, the home he and his wife, Mary Ellen, restored and enjoyed in North Berwick for more than 25 years. The Imlays hosted hundreds of their favorite people in their Scottish home.</p><h5><strong>Christopher W. Klaus -&nbsp;</strong>Technology entrepreneur; Founder and CEO of Kaneva Founder of Internet Security Systems</h5><p>Klaus is a successful entrepreneur, delivering 3D virtual worlds as the founder and CEO of Kaneva.
